# [PROJECT][https://github.com/mjsihu/portfolio]
This weeks project is building a portfolio website. I started making this website in the past week so this doesn't count as week 1!
The hardest part for me with this and other websites I build is the issue of design don't get me wrong, I love to design but let's just say my 
current eye for good design is not curated therefore my designs often lack in places and seem very dull and boring. 

To combat this I have tried the language learning approach of immersing and tried to inadvertently applying it to design. By watching web design content I surely have to get better at design right...?

I do not want to go too crazy, I am a big fan of minimalist design with a touch of naturalism so I went with a green theme and tried to keep it simple. Since i am a developer first and designer second I should let my work speak for itself not let the design do the talking. 
Plus a lot of portfolios seem to be over-featured lately and while its cool to see what you can do I think its smarter to find places 
that make the most sense for features instead of making a chimera of a website.

## Challenges
By far my biggest challenge when making websites still is the deployment process. I can get down the code fairly easily and get my designs working but for some reason. deploying always breaks everything even if it is a simple vite-typescript website! I just tried to deploy to github pages and I was bashing my head until I rewatched the video and realised I needed to switch from publish from branch -> github actions

## Goal of learning / headspace
My headspace and goal for this project was mainly looking for a job. I made a portfolio sight when I first started coding as a project, but as a developer with less than 2 months experience what could i do? now with over 1 year of experience and 2-3 large projects under my belt I feel a lot more comfortable and ready to make a portfolio


## What I learned and New things I did
I have been contributing to [yomitan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan) and noticed they used an OOP structure. Me coming from a mainly functional world decided to try and use this instead. I do not think I did it the best but it definitely gets the job done nonetheless. I never understood why you would use OOP instead of functional programming and while I currently still prefer functional, I see the organization aspect of OOP as well.
