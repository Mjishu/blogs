Today is the 5th of February, I remember coming across a video that was about a guy making 1 project every week for 1 year and this caught my attention. It hid away in the recess of my mind until you tube decided to show it to me again; thus here is the start of a great adventure!
My goal with this project is to see what I can make with a time crunch of 1 week and what journeys I come across along the way. Sure I will not finish every app within a week but I will try my hardest to stay within those bounds. My idea's right now start with a app that shows you camping spots near you to and even maybe an app that gives you new locations to go based on places you have been to before. 
To building a particle simulator in c and learning the intricacies of memory management and those pesky pointers.
I hope to become more comfortable with programming all together with this project and touch and build upon many different tools.

I do not want to set too many hard limits on myself besides the fact of 1 project per week but here are a few that I can think of.
1. learn C throughout this and figure out the root of programming? 2. do at least 3 projects on DSA from travailing knights to a chess solver.
and that's it! not a lot of requirements I am setting for myself. I just want to see what I can do within this time frame and I think that discovering what I want to do at each point in time is the wiser decision.

So here we go! In this place I will write about my adventures and issues and we will see what happens in 1 year from now!
